MrZamboni
=========

MrZamboni is Mike's first attempt at running DeepRacer on antoher hardware platform. He made a [write up](/2020/02/12/MrZamboni/) for his experiance.

The code for MrZambodi is [on Github](https://github.com/opendeepracer/mrzamboni-quick-hack-code), but it is pretty much a dump of the code directory on Mike's laptop without any guide as to how to build the code.

Cleaing up the code is currently work in progress.

You can see MrZambodi do a lap at AWS Re:invent below:
